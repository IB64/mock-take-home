# Update the is_log_line function below to skip lines that are not valid log lines.
# Valid log lines have a timestamp, error type, and message. For example, lines 1, 3,
# 7 and 37 are all examples of lines (from sample.log) that would be filtered out.
# There's no perfect way to do this: just decide what you think is reasonable to get
# the test to pass. The only thing you are not allowed to do is filter out log lines
# based on the exact row numbers you want to remove.
